This runs on my system. YMMV.


1. Make sure you're up to date, and nothing's weird:

    apt-get update
    apt-get dist-upgrade
    dpkg -l | grep -vE '^(un|ii|rc|rn) '       # should list no packages

2. Install these packages:

    dpkg -i *.deb

3. Tell apt to install all the dependencies they needed:

    apt-get -f install

That should be all.
